# HTRC-EF-Workshop

July 4, 2019

Welcome!

If you are reading this as one of our learners, you should navigate to: http://bitly.com/htrc-workshop. This is our Binder repository for the workshop that will provide you access to the workshop content and code execution.  

There is some extra content in the notebooks in case it comes up, but most of this is labeled as bonus or background.
